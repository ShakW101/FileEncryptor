Download this folder (FilEncryptor), and extract the folder to your computer.

Make sure your all these files are inside the same folder, and you have JAVA Runtime Environment to run the software.

If you don't, you can download it here : http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html

Read the Manual to find out how to encrypt and decrypt, and try decrypting the file I have given you. The decryption key for that file (PLEASE DO NOT EDIT ME DECRYPT ME.txt.ini) is 

“FilEncryptorDemo”

Remember! Capitals and Simples are considered in the key! (Case Sensitive)

When you download these, ignore if it says it will harm your computer. Trust me it won't.


Thanks,
Shakthi Weerawansa
